![temporary logo](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/73f55d7c-c31f-4a7c-890e-557b279269b4.jpg)

100SuperHumans is the name of the internship company to be established by Damian Dougherty. 

100SuperHumans has its main HQ in Kobe City, Japan.

The main objective of 100SuperHumans is to provide Bilingual Teaching, Counseling, Coaching, and Therapy at reasonable prices to elevate the happiness of humanity. 

100SuperHumans is first and foremost an internship business, which interviews potential students, offers partial or full scholarship (excluding housing, general costs of living), for students who show a strong and genuine desire to become bilingual or multilingual coaches, teachers, counselors or therapists. 

As the name of the business implies, there will only be 100 positions available. This includes Damian's position as well as any other staff. What this means is that 100SuperHumans will attract internship students who wish to be part of a new business, learning their trade within the business. Graduating internship students will be asked to return their services to the business, to the mutually agreed value of their tuition. The amount of hours graduating students can be expected to return to the business will be capped at a fair ceiling value. This maximum will apply to all internship students in order to not create an unreasonable relationship between themselves and the company. 

Should demand exceed the number of positions available, a franchise or some other similar management system may be utilized to create opportunities for other individuals with similar life-goals.

As this business has not been incorporated yet, all information displayed here are in the ideas and planning stage. It will be important for us to follow employment and legal etc etc guidelines of the jurisdictions governing the future company which we are planning.
